#Ten Minute Physics c

Just a porting to c of the JavaScript code.

Most of the programs require the `raylib` library.

You will alse need the `raygui` single-file header library (interface) and Sean Barret's single-file header `stb_ds.h` library (dynamic arrays).

TBDs:
- complete the demos interfaces.
- fix a leak on exit in fire demo.
- work on the demos involving actual meshes.
